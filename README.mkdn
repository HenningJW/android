CM Based Manifest
===========

Getting Started
---------------


To initialize your local repository using the my trees, use this command:

    repo init -u git://github.com/johnnyslt/android.git -b cm-10.1

Then to sync up:

    repo sync

After the initial sync sync once more so that the local_manifest.xml will be picked up.

After that you need to get proprietary CM bits:

    ./vendor/cm/get-prebuilts
